                <i>"As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. 
                Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep 
                the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called 
                to one hope when you were called; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all 
                and through all and in all."</i> &mdash; Ephesians 4:1-6 (NIV)</a>
